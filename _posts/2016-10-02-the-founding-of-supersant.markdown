title: The Founding of Supersant
---
Today I and An-Tim started our newest project - Supersant. It will revolve around finding good, new music and getting it out there for people to enjoy.

Send us tips for artists that you think should get more attention. We love listening to new music and we are in possesion of very open minds.

As you can see, we're not particularly good at designing our website and we'll be learning as we go. Thanks to the good people at [Jekyll] and [GitHub]. Without them we'd probably still be struggling to get the site online.

Best regards,
Aleks.
